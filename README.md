# JuliaIntro

This repository was my attempt to explore the workings of Julia, a new high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. Since I did not want to run this on my personal system, I managed to run it on Google Colab. More information on how to do that can be found [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58270424/julia-in-google-colab)
